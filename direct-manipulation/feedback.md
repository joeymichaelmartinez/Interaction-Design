| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Distinct bricks and balls (_3a_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Yep, there are bricks and balls alright. | 10 |  |
| **Brick creation (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Brick creation works as specified. | 20 |  |
| **Brick dragging (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Brick dragging works as specified—of course this was simply a matter of making sure the existing sample code for moving boxes didn’t break, but it still matters that you _didn’t_ break it! | 10 |  |
| **Ball motion (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Balls move as expected. | 10 |  |
| **Ball-to-brick collision (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Collision behavior is as expected, plus brick destruction and scoring bonus! | 27 |  |
| **Brick deletion (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Classic “trash can” design for deleting bricks; intersection logic works pretty well but ideally there is some feedback indicating that letting go would indeed trash a brick. | 23 | About-to-be-deleted feedback would have really refined the interaction design |
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | Jenkins green |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 22 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | last commit 1 day after due date |  |  |
|  |  | **100** | **Total** |
