| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Web Service Functions (_3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 3 API calls seen, all generally implemented correctly. Function decomposition is a good trait, but magic values 802 and 424 could have been given more explicit meaning. 802 is referenced as a literal on line 10 and in a string on line 73, while 424 is in a string on line 141. These can be turned into constants with proper substitutions done whenever they are used in the code. | 46 | Magic numbers |
| **Web App Layout (_2b_, _3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Clean, straightforward layout, mostly understandable even to a non-Pokémon expert except perhaps for the evolution chain. For a while, I thought that the evolution chain section was somehow related to the currently-displayed Pokémon (I was also under this impression based on my recollection of our discussions regarding your web front end), but eventually realized that they were completely independent. In that respect, a different layout approach might have communicated this to the user better.<br><br>There is a missed usability/efficiency opportunity here in that, after choosing a random Pokémon, only that Pokémon’s name shows up, and the user is asked to type that Pokémon’s name into the search field then click the button in order to learn about it. Wouldn’t it ultimately be more efficient to just load that Pokémon up once it is selected at random? I don’t see any usability reason for making the user type the name in separately.<br><br>Erroneous or empty searches are properly conveyed back to the user but the error messages are a little on the technical side. Failed searches aren’t as much about “Incorrect usage” as they are about an ID that is out of range or a name that does not match existing Pokémon. The user wasn’t necessarily _incorrect_ here; it’s just that their input did not match anything in the system. Some assistance to minimize that possibility would be nice. As a specific example, Pokémon IDs max out at 802 and evolutions max out at 424. Why not give (or enforce) that range up front, rather than wait for the user to type an out-of-range value?<br><br>Finally, there does appear to be some delay in getting the responses back (I remember that you said the API itself was sort of home-grown and not always very reliable), so while waiting for a response, some kind of feedback would be good (spinner, alert message, etc.). For example, I tried to search for a random Pokémon and was initially unsure of whether something was working or if things were just taking a while. It was the latter, but I didn’t get any signal to that effect.<br> | 23 | Random Pokémon selection needs to be retyped; meaning of evolution ID could be communicated more clearly; feedback during a lengthy load would minimize user confusion |
| **Test Suite (_4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 15 successes out of 15 tests—the number of tests at first appears to conflict with the low coverage, but upon code inspection the explanation appears: although there are a lot of `it` functions, a great many of them have no `expect`s at all. Although the `it` counts as a “test,” the absence of `expect`s means that the code isn’t actually checking on any behavior or values. This is what then emerges as low coverage.<br><br>Remember, it isn’t enough to run some code; tests also need to _verify_ that the results of the code are what the developer intends/expects them to be.<br><br>**Statements** 36/82 (43.90%)<br>**Branches** 0/6 (0.00%)<br>**Functions** 0/7 (0.00%)<br>**Lines** 36/81 (44.44%) | 12 | Low coverage despite number of tests, due to many tests not actually _testing_ anything
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | no errors |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 24 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time (extension granted) |  |  |
|  |  | **81** | **Total** |
