| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Application Description (_4d_)** | Ack why is everything in a blockquote? That is incorrect use of this style. Otherwise, the intent and scope of the application comes out clearly, though briefly. | -3 | Overall deduction for inappropriate use of blockquote throughout the document; blockquote was used in the template to indicate instructions |
| **Web Service(s) Used (_4d_)** | Utility scope is clearly stated. |  |  |
| **Top-Level Design/Layout (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Clear description, straightforward design, sufficiently illustrated. Annotated screenshots are a great ideaâ€”mockup or otherwise! |  |  |
| **Usage Scenario 1 (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Both usage scenarios given are pretty clearly described with no major design issues. The step-by-step screenshots are extremely helpful. |  |  |
| **Usage Scenario 2 (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | What I said in usage scenario 1 ðŸ™‚ |  |  |
| **Design Rationale (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Specific user interface elements are referenced in the rationale, with appropriate interaction design concepts, guidelines, principles, or theories attached to the design choices.<br><br>A minor desirable refinement, made more prominent because the preceding sections did this so well, would be include smaller, pinpoint illustrations (or, the same mockup illustrations but with specific parts encircled or highlighted) for the various user interface elements that are named in the rationale. This would have just helped to cement how these elements were indeed driven by the various guidelines, principles, and theories that are named here. | -1 | Missed opportunity to enhance rationale items with focused illustrations or screenshots |
| **Usability Metric Forecast (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Usability metric forecast makes sense given the design. Recognition of how certain elements may be subject to change based on user testing is a realistic perspective to take. |  |  |
| **Writing** | Writing is generally clear and clean, with only a few minor glitches. In terms of references though, only Shneiderman is formally cited in the text; formal citations should also be included for when the other three references are used or mentioned. | -2 | Missing formal citations for references |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 16 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time |  |  |
|  |  | **94** | **Total** |
